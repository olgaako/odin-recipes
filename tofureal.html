<h2> Learn how to make tofu the proper way!</h2>
<p><h4> For making crunchy, delicious tofu, you will want to be able to press the tofu prior to cooking it. An alternative to making well textured tofu is also to put the tofu block in the freezer, defrosting, and then cooking it. </h4></p>
<p> <head> <h3> Ingredients </h3> </head> </p>
<ul>
    <li>tofu</li>
    <li> salt and spices of choice</li>
    <li> cornstarch</li>
    <li> paper towels </li>
    <li>heavy object</li>


</ul>

<head> <h3> Steps </h3> </head>
<ol> 
    <li> Open the tofu package and drain the water out.</li>
    <li> Wrap the tofu in multiple layers of paper towels. Find a heavy object, such as a pickle jar, to set on top of the wrapped tofu. Press the tofu for at least 20 minutes. <ul> <li> This is meant to press water out - essential for well textured tofu!</li></ul></li>
    <li> After pressing the water out, cut the tofu into inch by inch blocks.</li>
    <li> Lightly cover the tofu with cornstarch. Oil the pan and set to a low flame. </li>
    <li> After cooking briefly on low heat, season the tofu by choice. <ul> <li> My personal favorite spices for tofu include white pepper, cayenne pepper, and turmeric. Tofu is very flexible for flavor! </li></ul></li>
    <li> After seasoning, raise the heat of the pan to high. Turn tofu as needed until it's crisp on the outside.</li>
